Hi, my name is Artem. I study applied mathematics in [National Research University of Electronic Technology](National Research University of Electronic Technology).

Currently, I'm an engineer at DevOps company Express42 in Moscow.

I'm passionate about learning new things and this blog is a summary of my learning process.

I think one of the most valuable principles of DevOps that I learned over the past years is sharing your knowledge.

As I learn and grow as a professional, I'll try to share my knowledge and experience here in this blog.

Hopefully, this blog will also be of some help to my fellow engineers to deal with the similar problems I had in the past :)
