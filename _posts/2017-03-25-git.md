Git is by far the most popular version control system(VCS) nowadays. Originally, developed back in 2005 by Linus Torvalds for his own needs, it was built performance, security and flexibility in mind.

Git has lots of handy features that make this VCS great and easy to use. It's also very well documented. But for a newcomer this documentation may seem overwhelming. And even if you read it all the first time, you're going to forget a lot of the stuff. Thus, I decided to write a short overview of the most important git commands and features I use every day in my work, so it might help someone who is new to this to get started. We'll also look at some useful programs that make your work with git even better.

Before we start with git configuration and usage, I want to list a few key concepts of this VCS which make it stand out among others:
* Decentralized -  everyone who "clones"(`git clone` command) a repository has an entire copy of the project locally.
    This has many advantages.

    First of all, you don't have to be connected to the central repository in order to work as it's the case with centralized systems like Subversion or VCS. So you can work offline

    You also don't need backups for your VCS. Because there is no central repository everybody has a complete version of it, there is no single point of failure and everyone's local copy of the repository could act as a backup.

* Snapshots, Not Differences
    Most other VCSs (Subversion,Bazaar,CVS) store information as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time. Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.
* Built-in integrity
    Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This means itâ€™s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it.
* Branching model
    Multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.

Well, that was just a few Git's concepts I wanted to note. For more information about Git works and its advantages I recommend reading the [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) as well as many tutorial which you can easily find on the internet.

#### Configure git
Imagine that we just installed git. What are the first steps we can or should take? Set your name and email address for identity. Every commit(record of changes to the repository) you make, will contain this information so the author could be identified.
~~~yml
$ git config --global user.name "Artem Star"
$ git config --global user.email artemstar@example.com
~~~
To see a list of set configuration options, you can use this command:
~~~yml
$ git config --list
~~~
_Global_ configration (specific to the current user) is usually stored under `~/.gitconfig`.

You may want to set `aliases` at this time. Aliases allow you create a `nickname` for a command. It helps to reduce the amount of typing you have to make:
~~~yml
# structure
# git config --global alias.<alias> <command>
$ git config --global alias.st status
$ git config --global alias.ci commit
$ git config --global alias.co checkout
~~~
And don't forget that you can also set aliases in your shell. For example, to `stage` everything in my working directory with a simple `ga` command, I set the following alias in my ~/.bashrc file (for Zsh it will be ~/.zshrc):
~~~yml
# User specific aliases and functions
alias ga='git add .'
~~~
Remember to `source ~/.bashrc` to start using your new alias immediately.

You can even go further and script git commands creating your own ^^. Here I script the ```git commit -m "message"``` command. First, I create ```gci``` script in my ```~/bin``` folder (folder my custom scripts):
```
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -ne 1 ] ; then
    echo 'Provide a message to your commit as a quoted parameter' && exit 1
fi

git ci -m "$@" # notice we use an alias created before
```
Then I make my script executable with ```chmod +x ~/bin/gci``` command and make sure that ```~/bin/``` directory is included in my ```PATH``` variable. To commit staged changes now, I simple type a command ```gci "my commit message"```

Now let's see a few commands which answer the most common questions of newcomers.

1. How to see commit history?
    [Git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) command lets you navigate through the history of your commits. I use this command quite often ```git log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit
``` which prints the history of the commits, where it has diverged, as well as branch pointers and tags:
    ![400x200](/public/img/git/git-log-history.jpg)
    As you can see, I created an alias for this command in my ~/.bashrc file (see above).

2. How to search through your commits?
  The coolest thing about ```git log``` is that it provides you with the handy options for search filtering.It offers options to base your seach on the specifie time frame or author. I find particularly useful search by the content.

   For example, you could find all the commits related to a specific task in JIRA:
    ~~~yml
    $ git log --grep="JRA-100"
    ~~~
    Or find the commit when a specific line of code was introduced _or_ deleted.
    ~~~yml
    $ git log -S "Hello, World!" # find a string, to use -G for regular expressions
    ~~~
    Real world example: recently I faced the problem that one of the community cookbooks I was using simply stopped working. When running ```chef update```  it gave me the following error.
    ```
    NoMethodError
    -------------
      No resource or method named `cached_file' for `LWRP provider seven_zip_archive from cookbook seven_zip ""'
    ```
    You can see this chef ouptu it was a [seven_zip](https://github.com/windowschefcookbooks/seven_zip) cookbook and inside its providers some unknown [cached_file](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/windows/blob/master/libraries/windows_helper.rb) method was called. I looked into the cookbook's code and found out that this ```cached_file``` was part of the [windows_helper](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/windows/blob/master/libraries/windows_helper.rb) which in turn is part of the windows cookbook. I looked at the latest version of this helper and in fact didn't find any definition of ```cached_file``` method, but apparently there was supposed to be one.
    So I cloned the repository on my local machine. And ran
    ~~~yml
    $ git log -S 'def cached_file' --oneline
    ~~~
    to see if there was any mentioning of this method inside windows cookbook repository. And I found there was indeed three of them:
    ![400x200](/public/img/git/faulty-commit.jpg)
    Considering the fact that ```git log -S``` shows commits when the code was introduced or deleted and that latest versions of files don't have it, obviously the first commit in this list should be the one when ```cached_file``` method was deleted.

    I was able to confirm it with ```git show <commit>``` command which gave showed me the changes brought by this commit:
    ![400x200](/public/img/git/git-deleted-method.jpg)
    If you prefer looking at the commit on github you can go to the URL ```https://github.com/<owner>/<project>/commit/<hash>```
    So in my case, I would go to <https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/windows/commit/5f0f8e0>

2. How to view the old version of my repository?
    To load a previous version of your repository, you can use this command:
    ~~~yml
    $ git checkout <commit> # you need to provide a commit hash or a tag
    ~~~
    Checking out an old commit is a read-only operation. So you it won't affect the current state of your repository. So it's mostly used for viewing an old revision. Although, you can create a separate branch to make your changes on the previous commit permanent.  To move the HEAD back to the tip of your branch and load the current state of your repository files, use this command:
    ~~~yml
    git checkout <current_branch_name>
    ~~~

3. How to revert back to an old version of a file?
    ~~~yml
    git checkout <commit> <file>
    ~~~
    This turns the <file> that resides in the working directory into an exact copy of the one from <commit> and adds it to the staging area. You can then re-commit the old version as you would any other file. As you can see, this does affect the current state of you repository. It basically serves as a way to revert back to an old version of an individual file.
4. How to undo a commit?
    There are two commands that can help you.
    * **git revert**

    ~~~yml
    git revert <commit>
    ~~~
    This command undoes the changes introduced by the commit and creates a new commit with the resulting content. It is considered to be a "safe" way of undoing changes because this operation doesn't change the commit history.

    ![400x400](/public/img/git/revert.png)
    This is the command you want to use when you need to fix a specific public(shared among others) commit in your history.
    * get reset - returns you to the commit you specify while removing all the commits made after that commit
    ~~~yml
    # undo the commits after <commit>, but don't touch the index nor remove the changes made to the repository
    $ git reset --soft <commit>
    # undo the commits after <commit>, reset the index, but don't remove the changes made to the repository
    $ git reset <commit>
    # Completely undo all commits and changes after <commit>
    $ git reset --hard <commit>
    ~~~
    _Git reset_ alters the history, which is why it's considered dangerous and should never been used to reset commits that have been already published to origin (which means other team members may have it).

    If ```revert``` is meant to undo public commits, ```reset``` is meant to undo local changes which were not pushed yet.   

    So if you experimenting on something locally and made a few commits that you wish to undo. ```git reset``` is the command to use.

    ~~~yml 
    # undo the last commit
    $ git reset HEAD~
    # make changes to commit again
    $ git add . # stage the files
    $ git ci -C # commit using the messages for the commit we reset
    ~~~

5. How to create a branch or list them?

    Branches allow you to diverge you main line of development and work on a new feature or fixing a bug. Git's branching model is often considered to be a killer feature. Git's branch is a simply a reference to the last commit of a series of commits. So it's not some sort of container for commits as you might think, nor does it include copying files from directory to directory. This makes Git's branches extremely lightweight and managed with ease.

    ![400x400](/public/img/git/branch.png)

    When a branch gets created, it basically meas that a new pointer is created that can be pointed to a series of commits.
    ~~~yml
    $ git branch <branch name>
    $ git branch -b <branch name> # create a branch and switch to it
    $ git branch -d <branch> # delete only if it has been merged
    $ git branch -D <branch> # delete branch
    $ git branch -m <new_name> # rename a branch
