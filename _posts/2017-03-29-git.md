  Master Git (part IV). Stash your changes
tags: [git, vercont]
---
Imagine a situation when you start working on some part of your project, make a bunch of uncommitted changes, but something urgent comes up that requires you to quickly make a few commits concerning another part of the project. In such cases, instead of losing the work you have already done, you can use **`git stash`** command to save your uncommitted changes away for later use while switching to another task.

Stashing in git is simple. All you need to do is to run
~~~yml
$ git stash
~~~
and git will make it look like those uncommitted changes are gone and your repository is clean:<!--break-->

And as you see, to recover stashed changes you use command
~~~yml
$ git stash pop
~~~

The thing you should be aware of is that git doesn't stash untracked files:

If we want to stash untracked file, we need to pass ```-u``` option:

You can stash more than once. In this case, you probably want to add messages to your stashes with
~~~yml
$ git stash save "message"
~~~

To see a list of all your stashes:
~~~yml
$ git stash list
~~~
![200x200](/public/img/git/git-stash-list.jpg)  
You manage your stashes by first looking at their identifier with  ```git stash list``` command and then using commands:
~~~yml
$ git pop <stash_id> # to re-apply a stash
$ git drop <stash_id> # to delete a stash
$ git stash clear # delete all stashes
~~~
