  Master Git (part I). Commit search.

[Git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) command lets you navigate through the history of your commits.
I personally use the following git log command and alias for it quite often:
~~~yml
# ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
  l=log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>'
~~~
which prints the history of the commits, where it has diverged, author of the commit and its message, as well as branch pointers and tags.

The coolest thing about ```git log``` is that it provides you with the handy options for search filtering. For example, it allows you to base your search on a specific time frame or author. I find particularly useful search by the message and content.

#### Grep commit messages
Git allows you to _grep_ commit messages. For example, you could use this simple command below to find all the commits related to a specific task in JIRA:
~~~yml
$ git log --grep="JIRA-30"
~~~
But I prefer to customize this command a bit, changing the output to my liking. So I created the following alias in my ```~/.giconfig``` file:
~~~yml
[alias]
    findm = log --pretty=\"format:%Cred%h %C(bold blue)%s %n %C(yellow)<%an> %Cgreen(%cD)\" --all --name-status --grep
~~~
Now I can use ```git findm "JIRA-30"``` to see all the commits across all branches (```--all```) which have ```JIRA-30``` in their message. In the output I will get abbreviated commit hash (```%h```) in green, a commit message (```%s```) in blue, and information about the author and data of the commit in red (```%an```, ```%cD```).

#### See commits that affected a file
In case, you would like to see commits that changed a particular file(s). You can use the following command:
~~~yml
git log -- <path/to/file>
~~~
For such cases, I use the following alias:
~~~yml
[alias]
    findf = log --pretty=\"format:%Cred%h %C(bold blue)%s %n %C(yellow)<%an> %Cgreen(%cD)\"
~~~

####  Search by the commit content
If you want to find a commit when a specific line of code was introduced _or_ deleted, you can make use of -S option of git log command:
~~~yml
$ git log -S "Hello, World!" # use -G for regular expressions
~~~
**Real world example:** recently I faced the problem that one of the community cookbooks I was using for quite some time started to fail. The output from ```chef run``` gave me the following error:
~~~yml
NoMethodError
-------------
  No resource or method named `cached_file' for `LWRP provider seven_zip_archive from cookbook seven_zip ""'
~~~

_For people who are not familiar with Chef, to put it in most basic terms, a cookbook could be compared to a script that configures the system. Often those scripts use classes and methods defined in another cookbooks (scripts). And here we see the problem, when changes in one script affect the work of another._

You can see from the output above that it was a [seven_zip](https://github.com/windowschefcookbooks/seven_zip) cookbook and inside its providers some unknown [cached_file](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/windows/blob/master/libraries/windows_helper.rb) method was called.I looked into the cookbook's code and found out that this ```cached_file``` was part of the [windows_helper](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/windows/blob/master/libraries/windows_helper.rb) which in turn is part of the windows cookbook. I looked at the current version of this helper and didn't find any definition of ```cached_file``` method, but apparently there was supposed to be one.

So I cloned the repository on my machine. And ran
~~~yml
$ git log -S 'def cached_file' --oneline
~~~
to see if there was any mentioning of this method inside windows cookbook repository. And I found there was indeed three of them:

Considering the fact that ```git log -S``` shows commits when the code was introduced _or_ deleted and that latest version of files didn't have it, obviously the first commit in this list should be the one when ```cached_file``` method was deleted.

I was able to confirm it with ```git show <commit>``` command which  showed me the changes brought by this commit:

If you prefer looking at the commit on github you can use this URL template:
~~~yml
https://github.com/<owner>/<project>/commit/<hash>
~~~
So in my case, I went to

<https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/windows/commit/5f0f8e0>

With the help of this ```git log``` command, I was able to quickly find when the code was removed and which version of the windows cookbook was still good to use.

_P.S. Soon after they added the method back to the  [windows_helper](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/windows/commit/edfc6240b55e60cd393c472a935c836ace86eb84). Apparently, there were more cookbooks that used this helper's method._
