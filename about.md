Hi, my name is Artem.

Currently, I work as an engineer at DevOps company Express 42 in Moscow.

I'm passionate about learning new things and this blog is a summary of my learning process.

I think one of the most valuable principles of DevOps that I learned over the past years is how important to share your knowledge.

As I learn and grow as a professional, I'll talk about my experience and my new learnings here in this blog.

I hope this blog will be of some help to my fellow engineers to boost their knowledge and maybe even deal with some similar problems I had in the past :)
